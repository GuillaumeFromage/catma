AccessTokenDialog.overallDescription=A Personal Access Token allows you to give an external system read-only access to your CATMA data for a limited time.\
<br/><br/>\
Personal Access Tokens are similar to your password, and should be handled with the same amount of care. \
<strong>Keep created tokens secret and only share them with systems that you know and trust!</strong>\
<br/><br/>\
Some additional pointers:<br/>\
<ul>\
<li>Give your token a name that allows you, or our support team, to easily identify it later. For example: the name of the external system it is for</li>\
<li>The token is valid for one month by default, up to a maximum of three months</li>\
<li>The token is displayed only once - if you forget to copy it, you'll have to create a new one</li>\
<li>\
The external system will have <strong>read-only access to <em>all</em> of your projects, as well as projects that you have joined</strong><br/>\
(please ensure that you have read and understood the relevant sections of our <a href="https://catma.de/documentation/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy \
Policy</a> and <a href="https://catma.de/documentation/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, in particular the sections relating to "allowing other \
systems/tools to access data")\
</li>\
<li>Contact our support team if you need to revoke a token, or if you have any other query related to the use of tokens</li>\
<li>For expert users: you can also manage your tokens directly by logging in to our GitLab backend</li>\
</ul>
