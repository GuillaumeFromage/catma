VegaHelpWindow.helpText=<p>This URL represents the JSON formatted query results. \
You can either use this URL as the data URL or provide the data directly as values or use the placeholder CATMA_QUERY_URL which will be replaced with this URL.</p>\

<ul>\
<li>sourceDocumentId - The identifier of the Source Document this row belongs to.</li> \
<li>phrase - The phrase of this row.</li> \
<li>startOffset - The start character offset of this row.</li> \
<li>endOffset - The end character offset of this row.</li> \
<li>sourceDocumentSize - The size of the document in number of characters.</li> \
<li>sourceDocumentTitle - The title of the Source Document.</li> \
</ul> \
If the query was a tag based query each row provides these additional fields: \
<ul>\
<li>annotationCollectionId - The identifier of the Annotation Collection.</li> \
<li>tagId - The identifier of the Tag.</li>\
<li>tagPath - The path that represents the full hierarchy of the Tag.</li> \
<li>tagVersion - The version identifier of the Tag.</li> \
<li>annotationId - The identifier of the Annotation</li> \
<li>propertyId - The identifier of the Property if the query was a Property based query, otherwise this field has a null value.</li> \
<li>propertyName - The name of the Property if the query was a Property based query, otherwise this field has a null value.</li> \
<li>propertyValue - The value of the Property if the query was a Property based query, otherwise this field has a null value.</li> \
</ul> \
</p>\
<p>If the annotation has more than one reference to the text, i. e. there are more than one startOffset - endOffset pair, a row for each text range is included.</p>\
